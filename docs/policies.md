## No Refunds

We don't promise anything. While we try to be secure, and while we try not to lose all your data, neither of those are things we can actually deliver on with our current staffing. We also don't take any sort of backups - in other words, if we get ransomeware'd, you accidentally `rm -rf /bighome/*`, or you give your password to someone who doesn't like you, we can't help.

## No Privacy

Though this falls under the above, we also cannot guerentee the privacy nor integrity of your data. It could be read, modified, or deleted by anyone on the network at any time.
